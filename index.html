        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Ashlyn Sassaman. 
            <p>I worked tirelessly from the bottom of the restaurant food chain (pun intended) to working at some of the most prestigous restaurants in Washington, D.C. After ten years in the restaurant industry, I am working towards a career change in software development. Using Codecademy, I am learning the necessary skills to become a full stack developer. </p>
          
            <p>During the past year, I have committed my time before and after restaurant shifts to learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have discovered a passion for problem solving and the rush of fixing a particularly difficult bug in my programs. </p>
          
            <p>I am looking for the opportunity to learn and grow with a tech company that will take me on as an apprentice. I have learned on the job to make it to the top once, and I plan on doing it again. </p>
